# Movie_app
I learned how to build a movie app using JavaScript. 🎥 The app lets users search for movies by typing in the search bar. 🔍 The app then talks to The Movie Database to get movie data based on the user's input. The retrieved movie info, like titles, is shown dynamically on the web page. 💡
The app uses JavaScript event listeners to listen for user input and sends requests accordingly. 📤 The fetched data is then processed and displayed on the user interface using DOM manipulation. 💻
I learned to build this movie app by Florin Pop on YouTube. 🎓🎥
